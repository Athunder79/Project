                <h3>Bio</h3>
                <p>Sean Carey is an American musician from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, best known as the drummer and
                    supporting vocalist of indie folk band Bon Iver. In August 2010, Carey released his first solo
                    album, All We Grow, which he began working on in 2008 during hiatuses from performing with the band.
                    Comparisons have been drawn between Carey's harmonies and those of Brian Wilson in his 2004 album
                    Smile. His music has also been likened to that of Sufjan Stevens, Fleet Foxes, Iron &amp; Wine, José
                    González, Steve Reich, and Talk Talk.</p>
