                    <h3>Bio</h3>
                    <p>Sean Carey is an American musician from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, best known as the drummer and supporting vocalist of indie folk band Bon Iver. In August 2010, Carey released his first solo album, All We Grow, which he began working on in 2008 during hiatuses from performing with the band.
                        Comparisons have been drawn between Carey's harmonies and those of Brian Wilson in his 2004 album Smile. His music has also been likened to that of Sufjan Stevens, Fleet Foxes, Iron &amp; Wine, José González, Steve Reich, and Talk Talk.</p>
